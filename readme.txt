Thanks for using CERNSSO!

Windows Phone 8 and Windows Store:
- Same API now, using Universal App class library. May break your code!!!

Windows Desktop
- Same API as before, seperate library all together (of course).

Development:

- You'll need to have a CERN certificate called "cert.pks12" in the solution directory for the tests to run. Along with it a file called password.txt in order to get into that cert.
